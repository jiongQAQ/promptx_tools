  "content": "This paper presents a comprehensive canteen rating management system designed to revolutionize campus dining service quality control through digital transformation. The system employs a robust three-tier architecture utilizing Spring Boot 2.7.18 for backend services, Vue.js 3.3.4 for responsive frontend interfaces, and MyBatis Plus 3.5.3.1 for efficient data persistence, all orchestrated within a MySQL 8.0+ database environment. The implementation encompasses five core functional modules: user authentication management with JWT-based security mechanisms, intelligent dish rating algorithms enabling comprehensive evaluation metrics, systematic stall management facilitating operational oversight, automated complaint handling workflows ensuring quality assurance, and advanced statistical analytics providing actionable insights. The system addresses critical challenges in traditional campus dining management, including delayed feedback mechanisms, inconsistent quality monitoring, and inadequate data-driven decision making. Through extensive testing involving functional validation, performance benchmarking, and compatibility verification across multiple browser environments, the system demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction, operational efficiency, and management effectiveness. This research contributes to the academic understanding of digital service transformation in educational institutions while providing a practical solution for enhanced campus dining experiences.",
