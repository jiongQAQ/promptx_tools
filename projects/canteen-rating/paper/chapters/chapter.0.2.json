  "text": "With the continuous expansion of higher education scale, university canteens serve as essential components of daily campus life, directly affecting the physical and mental health and quality of life for faculty and students. However, traditional canteen management models commonly suffer from inefficient feedback channels, incomplete service quality evaluation mechanisms, and lack of data-driven decision support, failing to meet the requirements of modern campus management. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes the practical needs of campus canteen evaluation management and designs and implements a comprehensive canteen rating system. The system adopts a front-end and back-end separation architecture, with the back-end built on the Spring Boot framework providing RESTful API services, the front-end implemented using Vue.js framework for responsive user interfaces, and the data persistence layer utilizing MyBatis Plus to simplify database operations. The system implements core functional modules including user authentication management, dish rating management, canteen stall management, complaint and suggestion management, and system statistical analysis, establishing a comprehensive permission control system and data security assurance mechanism. Through this system, ordinary users can conveniently provide multi-dimensional evaluations of canteen dishes, while administrators can monitor service quality status in real-time and obtain data-driven decision support, effectively improving canteen service quality and management efficiency. The system has undergone functional testing and performance validation, demonstrating stable operation, user-friendly interface, and good scalability and practical value.",
