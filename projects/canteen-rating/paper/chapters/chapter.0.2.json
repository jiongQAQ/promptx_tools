  "content": "With the rapid development of information technology in higher education, traditional canteen management systems face significant challenges in student feedback collection and service quality improvement. This paper presents the design and implementation of an intelligent canteen rating system specifically tailored for university environments. The research addresses critical issues including ineffective communication channels between students and canteen management, lack of systematic evaluation mechanisms, and insufficient data-driven decision support for service optimization. The proposed solution adopts a modern technical architecture combining Spring Boot framework for robust backend services, Vue.js for responsive user interfaces, and MySQL database for reliable data persistence. The system implements five core functional modules: user authentication management, dish rating mechanisms, canteen and stall management, complaint handling processes, and comprehensive administrative functions. Through systematic analysis, detailed design, and thorough testing, the developed system demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement, feedback efficiency, and management effectiveness. The research contributes both practical value for university canteen digitalization and academic insights for information system development in educational contexts. Future enhancements may include mobile application integration, artificial intelligence-powered recommendation systems, and advanced analytics capabilities for predictive management decision support."
